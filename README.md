![Sample of the SBST 2016 Presentation](sbst2016_position.png)

This repository contains the HTML source code and additional resources for a
presentation that I, [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham), gave as a position
paper at the [Ninth International Workshop on Search-Based Software
Testing](https://cse.sc.edu/~ggay/sbst2016/) (SBST 2016). The presentation's
source code uses the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
framework to control the display of each slide. I have developed a custom theme
for the slides that manages the formatting, color scheme, and the use of
full-screen photographs on the backgrounds.

You are welcome to use these slides as inspiration for your own presentation.
If you find this example useful, could I trouble you to star this repository
and then acknowledge it in your own presentation slides? If you would like to
learn more about my research publications, then you can check out my GitHub
repository called
[gkapfham/research-bibliography](https://github.com/gkapfham/research-bibliography).

Are you interested in previewing the presentation without having to download
the code and resources from the GitHub site? Well, you can! Please view
